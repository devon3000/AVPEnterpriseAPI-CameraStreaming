#Vision Pro Enterprise API Main Camera Streaming#

This example project shows how to access the Vision Pro main front-mounted camera using the new [Enterprise API entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/building-spatial-experiences-for-business-apps-with-enterprise-apis) available for private apps. 

In order to demo something useful with the camera, it also livestreams the microphone and main camera to YouTube using RTMP. This functionality makes use of the excellent [HaishinKit package](https://github.com/shogo4405/HaishinKit.swift) for video streaming along with the VideoToolbox package.

This project is a testbed, used to explore different applications of the Enterprise API, and I expect to continue to develop it to support WebRTC and perhaps other forms of connectivity, as well as the ARKit functionality and perhaps other API functions.
